### How its made:
Skill used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I made the student list by first creating onclick for my buttons. Created functions for my buttons including the display the items on the list. After that I created the local storage by creating an addEventListener click function.

### What was learned 
One thing I learned is how to show how many items were in the list. I appended the li and ul then added a count if anything was added. After that I displayed the messege and emptied out the input box. This was one of the things I had a hard time figuring out I relearned the importance of asking for help.
