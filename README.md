# 👩🏾‍🎓 Week05 Bootcamp2018c Project: Student List
This project is made to record names of people who are present and are not present. Create a simple app where a teacher can enter student names as they arrive at class. The teacher has the ability to press a button and see a list off all the students who have arrived color coding for whos absent or not present.

### How its made:
Skill used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I made the student list by first creating onclick for my buttons. Created functions for my buttons including the display the items on the list. After that I created the local storage by creating an addEventListener click function.

### What was learned 
One thing I learned is how to show how many items were in the list. I appended the li and ul then added a count if anything was added. After that I displayed the messege and emptied out the input box. This was one of the things I had a hard time figuring out I relearned the importance of asking for help.
